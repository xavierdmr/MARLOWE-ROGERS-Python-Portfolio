## Projects

### Portfolio Update 1 App: "Pick A Penguin"

- Displays information on hundreds of different penguins and allows the user to filter based on certain criteria to ultimately select a singular penguin.

- **INSTRUCTIONS** - This app runs on the streamlit framework. To run in VS code, open the terminal and enter the command: "**cd basic-streamlit-app**" followed by the command "**streamlit run main.py**".

### Portfolio Update 2: [Tidy Data Project - Olympic Medalist Analysis](https://github.com/xavierdmr/MARLOWE-ROGERS-Python-Portfolio/tree/main/TidyData-Project)

- The **Tidy Data Project** is an exercise in data cleaning and analysis as I demonstrate my ability to restructure and analyze a real-world dataset.

- Key components of this project include:
    - Reshaping data using 'pd.melt()' and 'str.split()'
    - Visualization techniques such as bar charts, stacked bar charts, and pie charts
    - Pivot tables to summarize insights and support aggregation
    - Application of Hadley Wickham's "Tidy Data" principles 

- This project complements my overall portfolio by highlighting my skills in **data wrangling, data analysis, and visualization**.

### Portfolio Update 3: [NER Streamlit App](https://rogers-ner-app.streamlit.app/)

- This project is a Streamlit App that allows users to upload or paste in text to be processed using Named Entity Recognition (NER) in spaCy.

- Key components of this project include:
    - Allowing users create their own custom entity patterns using EntityRuler
    - Displaying labeled text using spaCy's displaCy visualization tool
    - Additional analysis of entity patterns through a table that aggregates the most frequent label-text combinations
      
- This project complements my overall portfolio by highlighting my understanding of **natural language processing** and my proficiency in **spaCy**.

### Final Project: [Country Comparison App](https://wdi-country-comparison.streamlit.app/)

- The Country Comparison App is an interactive Streamlit application that enables users to explore and compare international development indicators (such as GDP, population, or life expectancy) across multiple countries and time periods. 

- Key components of this project include:
    - Allowing users to upload their own CSV files or use the provided World Bank sample data
    - Dynamic country and indicator selection using Streamlit widgets
    - Interactive line and bar charts with auto-scaling axes for readability using **matplotlib**
    - A filtered data table that updates based on user selections

- Economics is my field of study, and this project complements my overall portfolio by showcasing my ability to work with real-world economic data, implement robust **user interactivity**, and deploy a polished **data visualization app** using **Streamlit**.
