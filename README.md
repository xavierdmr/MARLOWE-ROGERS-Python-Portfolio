## Projects

Portfolio Update 1 App: "Pick A Penguin"

- Displays information on hundreds of different penguins and allows the user to filter based on certain criteria to ultimately select a singular penguin.

- **INSTRUCTIONS** - This app runs on the streamlit framework. To run in VS code, open the terminal and enter the command: "**cd basic-streamlit-app**" followed by the command "**streamlit run main.py**".

Portfolio Update 2: [Tidy Data Project - Olympic Medalist Analysis](https://github.com/xavierdmr/MARLOWE-ROGERS-Python-Portfolio/tree/main/TidyData-Project)

- The **Tidy Data Project** is an exercise in data cleaning and analysis as I demonstrate my ability to restructure and analyze a real-world dataset.

- Key components of this project include:
    - Reshaping data using 'pd.melt()' and 'str.split()'
    - Visualization techniques such as bar charts, stacked bar charts, and pie charts
    - Pivot tables to summarize insights and support aggregation
    - Application of Hadley Wickham's "Tidy Data" principles 

- This project complements my overall portfolio by highlighting my skills in **data wrangling, data analysis, and visualization**.
