# üèÖ Olympic Medalist Data Analysis (2008 Beijing Summer Olympics) ‚Äì Tidy Data Project

---

## Project Overview:

This project investigates medalist data from the 2008 Summer Olympics using **Python** and **Jupyter Notebook**. 

The main goal is to clean and reshape what was originally a messy, wide-format dataset into a **tidy, long-format dataset** in order to enable clear and efficient data analysis and visualization.

Throughout this project I apply the 3 key tidy data principles:
- **Each variable forms a column** (gender, sport, and medal type)
- **Each observation forms a row** (one medal awarded)
- **Each type of observational unit forms a table** 

In the case of this project, we have only one type of observational unit: Olympic medals. We therefore only work with one table.

This enables the user to:
- Summarize the distribution of medals across sports and gender
- Create stacked bar charts, pie charts, and pivot tables to illlustrate trends in the data
- Analyze patterns and trends in the data across gender, sport, and medal type

## Dataset Description

- Source: [**olympics.csv**](olympics.csv) ‚Äì data on medalists from the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing
- Structure:
    - The original dataset is in wide format, with one column per gender-sport combination
    - Each row initially represents a medalist, with only one medal per row.
- No other pre-processing steps are required, as all data cleaning and analysis occurs within the notebook itself.
