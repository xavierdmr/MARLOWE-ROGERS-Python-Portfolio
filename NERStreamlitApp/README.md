# Named Entity Recognition (NER) Streamlit App

This app allows users to explore Named Entity Recognition (NER) using spaCy.
Users can input or upload text, define custom entity patterns using EntityRuler, and visualize named entities directly in the app using spaCy's built-in displaCy visualizer.

## Project Overview
Named Entity Recognition (NER) is an aspect of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that identifies entities such as people, organizations, and locations within provided text.

This app:
- Uses spaCy's pre-trained English language model (en_core_web_sm) to detect standard named entities
- Lets users define their own custom patterns (e.g., WIZARD: Gandalf) using spaCyâ€™s EntityRuler
- Displays detected entities with color-coded highlights using displaCy
- Analyzes and summarizes the top 10 most frequent entities and the frequency of their occurence in the text

## Setup Instructions
### Running the App Locally:
- Clone this repository
- Ensure all necessary dependencies are installed (pandas, spaCy, streamlit)
- Run the app using the command "streamlit run main.py"
### Link to Deployed Version:
- Try the app live here:

## App Features
### Text Input:
- Paste Text directly into the input box or upload a .txt file for automatic analysis
### Define Custom Entity Patterns:
- Add your own entities using this format: LABEL:TEXT
- LABEL represents what you want the recognized text/pattern to be labeled as
- TEXT represents the text that you want to be considered under that label
### Visualize Entities
- Entities are highlighted in the text using spaCy's displaCy visualization tool
- The app shows both built-in and user-defined entities
### Analyze Entity Frequency
- View a table of the top 10 most common Label-Text combinations
- Helpful for getting an overall summary of what entities are being detected most frequently
