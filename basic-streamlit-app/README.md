## "Pick A Penguin" app
This is an app that presents the user with data (imported from Canvas) on over 300 penguins and enables the user to filter by characteristic to ultimately select one penguin.

While the data includes penguin species, island of origin, bill and flipper size, body mass, sex, and year of birth, I only include drop-down filters for species and sex, with a slider for body mass.

## Try the app!
Type the following into the terminal to run the app:
streamlit run basic_streamlit_app/main.py

The CSV file with the penguin data (penguins.csv) is referenced from the local data folder, so you must be within my basic-streamlit-app directory
